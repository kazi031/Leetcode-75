Often, when dealing with iterators, we also get need to keep a count of iterations. 
Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task. 
Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerating object. 
This enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted into a list of 
tuples using the list() function.

Syntax:
enumerate(iterable, start=0)
